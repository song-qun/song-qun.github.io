#### About SUTD ####
Established in collaboration with MIT, the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) is the fourth public university in Singapore. SUTD emphasizes a multidisciplinary curriculum and research, aiming to create impactful solutions for a better future. In the 2023 Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), SUTD ranked 23rd globally in Telecommunication Engineering and 76-100th in Electrical & Electronic Engineering. SUTD was selected by MIT as one of the "Top 10 emerging leaders in engineering education" and ranked 1st in the world.
<!-- According to the "Global state of the art in engineering education" report released by MIT in 2018, SUTD was selected as the "Top 10 emerging leaders in engineering education" in the world and ranked 1st. -->
<!-- TU Delft is the oldest and largest Dutch public technical university, located in Delft, Netherlands. According to 2022 QS World University Rankings, TU Delft is ranked 10th for Engineering & Technology globally. The Embedded Systems Group of TU Delft is a world-leading research group in the fields of embedded systems, mobile computing, and networking. The group has strong publication records in top-tier conferences including SIGCOMM, MobiCom, SenSys, IPSN, UbiComp, INFOCOM, SIGMETRICS, etc. The MobiCom 2020 Best Paper and Best Paper Runner-Up are awarded to the group members. Ph.D. graduates and postdocs from the group found jobs in Google, Meta, Amazon, Samsung, and MSR as well as assistant professor positions in world-famous universities including TU Delft, University of Trento, and Wageningen University. Note that Dutch language is not required for the candidate since the Netherlands is the top English-Speaking country outside the Anglosphere and English is the official working language at TU Delft. -->
