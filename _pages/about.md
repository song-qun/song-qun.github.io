<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I received my Ph.D. from Nanyang Techonological University, Singapore in 2022. I was supervised by Prof. [Tan Rui](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/tanrui/) leading the [NTU IoT Sensing Group](https://ntuiot.xyz/). Before that, I received B.Eng. from Nankai University in 2018.

I am broadly interested in AIoT (AI+IoT), sensing, mobile computing, and deep learning. My goal is to build deployable AI-powered autonomous cyber-physical systems that are resilient and resource-aware. My research aims at addressing the practical challenges of landing AI on IoT systems including the adversarial examples and privacy attacks, cross-modal learning, domain shift, and computation constraints.

I will be joining TU Delft as an assistant professor. I am looking for one Ph.D. to conduct system research on resilient and deployable AIoT. Check the job description [here](https://song-qun.github.io/opening/).

<!-- My research interests also include exploiting physical knowledge to advance the learning process on embedded devices and developing privacy-preserved AIoT systems. -->
