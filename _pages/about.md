<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.

I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD) Pillar, Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). I was an Assistant Professor at 
<!-- the [Embedded Systems Group](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/embedded-systems) of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) at  -->
Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands, from 2022 to 2024. I received my Ph.D. from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Before that, I received my B.Eng. from Nankai University.

My research interests include Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems, artificial intelligence, and security for autonomous driving. My goal is to build AI-powered autonomous cyber-physical systems that are robust, resilient, and resource-efficient. My research aims to address the practical challenges of landing AI on IoT systems, including the adversarial examples, privacy attacks, cross-modal learning, domain shift, and computation constraints.

**<font color = red>I am seeking multiple Ph.D. students and RAs to join my research team and work on resilient and deployable AIoT systems. Check the job description [here](https://song-qun.github.io/opening/).</font>**

<!-- My research interests also include exploiting physical knowledge to advance the learning process on embedded devices and developing privacy-preserved AIoT systems. -->
