<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD) Pillar, Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). I was an Assistant Professor at Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands, from 2022 to 2024.
<!-- I am currently an Assistant Professor in the [Embedded Systems Group](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/embedded-systems) of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) at Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands. -->
I received my Ph.D. from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Before that, I received my B.Eng. from Nankai University.

My research interests include Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems, and artificial intelligence. My goal is to build AI-powered autonomous cyber-physical systems that are robust and efficient. My research aims to address the practical challenges of deploying AI for CPS/IoT applications, including adversarial examples, privacy attacks, cross-modal learning, domain shifts, and computation constraints.

<!-- **I am seeking multiple Ph.D. students and RAs to join my research team and work on resilient and deployable AIoT systems. Check the job description [here](https://song-qun.github.io/opening/).** -->

**<span style="color: red;">I have openings for 1-2 fully-funded Ph.D. students with strong interest in developing robust and efficient AI-powered CPS/IoT systems. Check the job description [here](https://song-qun.github.io/opening-PhD/).</span>**

**<span style="color: red;">I have openings for 1-2 research assistants/associates/fellows to work on acoustic SLAM. Check the job description [here](https://song-qun.github.io/opening-acoustic-SLAM/).</span>**

**<span style="color: red;">Self-funded and CSC-funded visiting students are welcome to join our team.</span>**


<!-- My research interests also include exploiting physical knowledge to advance the learning process on embedded devices and developing privacy-preserved AIoT systems. -->
